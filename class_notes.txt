Moving forward:
QA analyst - fundamentals, tools (sql, linux), automation(optional), finance, interview -> market (80-110)
QA Engineer/Analyst - fundamentals, tools (sql, linux), automation, finance, interview  -> market (90 - 110)
QA Engineer - fundamentals, tools (sql, linux), automation(some additional), finance, interview (ask Akmal) -> market (95-120)

BA/QA or BA - fundamentals, tools (sql, linux), automation(optional), BA class, finance, interview  -> market  (100-150)
			- automation is optional more concentrate to BA ( ask Said)

## Agenda: Lists in Python

- Code refactoring
	In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software, while preserving its functionality.

- Pycharm shortcuts: 
	Autoformating: ctrl + Alt + L based on PEP-8 Style Guide:
	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/


### What is Data structrues?
	In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.[1][2][3] More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
	
	A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
	
	Reading on Data structures: 
	https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/data-types-and-data-structures/
	https://towardsdatascience.com/8-common-data-structures-every-programmer-must-know-171acf6a1a42
	
For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.

### what is list?
	odds = [1, 3, 5, 7 ]
	new variable
	vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
working with lists
create, edit, remove, access

-----------------------------------------------
## 03/07/2021
## Working with lists (continue)

Temporary sorting:
- new_list = sorted(list)
- new_list_rev = sorted(list, reverse=True)

Permanent sorting:
- list.sort()
- list.sort(reverse=True)
- list.reverse()

Types of Errors we can see dealing with list? IndexError: list index out of range
What is object? What is iterable? what is return statement? why I have None on print() functions?


Looping through the list: 
for odd in odds:
	print(odd)

concatenate in the loop

- Indentation Errors
	in the loop
	outside the loop
	not a loop

- colons

Next class Agenda:
- Making Numerical lists:
	range()
	list(range(1, 5))

- Statistics: 
	min(), max(), sum()
	
- list comprehensions

------------------------------
## 03/13/2021
### 1. Styling the code
PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code
autoformatting in pycharm - ctrl + alt + L
Line Length

### 2. Working with part of a list
Slicing
Copying the list

### 3. Tuples

### 4. If statement
    - various expression that we can use in if statement
    - using simple comparison (numbers, strings, etc)
    - using 'in' operator with range() function
    - using 'in' operator with lists
    - if statement in for loop

### Agenda for next class (03/14/2021):
- if statement with multiple conditions
- if statement with multiple 'elif' statements
- using multiple lists (using pizza example)
- Some problem solving examples

### Homework:
Implement sum() with for loop
Double characters in a string (e.g. “abc” => “aabbcc”)
for letter in "hello":
    print(letter)
Prove that a number is a prime
Prove that a string is a palindrome (mom, dad, madam, kayak etc)

#### Websites to practice problem solving:
- https://codingbat.com/python

## Agenda: 03/20/2021
- dictionaries - new data structure (1-2)
- looping in dictionary
- dictionary/list with list/dictionary as a value

#### H/W
- 6-6. Polling:
- print multiplication table
- 6-7 to 6-12

## Agenda 03/21/2021
- Keywords to note: stack, buffer
- while loop ( 0.5)

### H/W
a. exercises for problem solving:
    1. How to swap 2 variable values. e.g.: a=45 b=78 >> a=78 b=45
    2. Count the vowels ('aeuoi') in any phrase/sentence/word.
    user enters any phrase, you return:
    print(f"number of {vowels}'s is : {count}")
    3. Count each letter in any phrase
        Pseudocode:
        - loop through the text
        - create a dictionary for this letters
        - add each letter to the dictionary as a key and count (starting from 0) as a value
        - every time you add a letter to a dictionary check if dictionary has the same key, if dictionary has a key you increment the valeu
        if dictionary does not have you create new element and value = 1
        a: 1+1, d: 1+1, e: 1

        - how to find mostly used letter in the text:
        you have a dictionary now, you need find out what is the largest value(count) and print/return the key of that value


    4. Find the first mostly used letter in a phrase.
        (max(), dictionary, add to dictionary, if the key is in the dictionary, increment)

#### Agenda for 03/27/2021:

### Functions (continue)

|-3| = 3 >>> abs(-3) =3

Primitive data type: float, integer, string, boolean
Data structures: dictionary, list, tuples

**Modules**
 - files containing your python functions

Importing modules to reuse your function anywhere in the project
Packages
ctrl + alt + o - to optimize the imports in the module

Imports:
    import time
    import functions_pkg.functions_return
    import functions_pkg.functions_return as ft

    from time import sleep
    from functions_pkg.functions_return import print_formatted_name
    from module_name import function_0, function_1, function_2

    from time import *
    from functions_pkg.functions_return import *

## Agenda for 03/28/2021:

### Classes and object (Chapter 9)
Object-oriented programming concepts:
- class - blueprint or template code for replicating real-world things or situation, it will have state (attributes) and behavior (methods - functions)

- object - instance of the class; it is a variable that will have an access to class state and behavior, this is used to execute the class functions

- constructor - it is __init__() method(function), it is initializing method in the class, this will help python to define the class on execution

- self - this is the keyword that identifies current class, it shows that attributes and functions are class level or belongs to class.
    super() - refers to parent class (when inheritance is used).

- instance variables - variable defined in the constructor (attributes)

- class names should be with upper case:
    Car() is good, car() is not good

- instantiation - process of creating an object of the class

- encapsulation - hiding data from object(users)

#### HW:
- read chapter 9
- exercises: from 9-1 to 9-5

### Agenda:
- Class: inheritance
Inheritance works one way from parent class to child class, not other way around.
- we can reuse all attributes and methods from parent class
- we can create new attributes (available to child only)
- we can create new methods(functions, available to child only)
- we can override the method that parent had (OOPs - Method Overriding)

#### HW: all exercises from chapter 9 (9-1 to 9-9)

### Agenda 04/04/2021:
- Exercises and Q & A
- Working with Files
- Handling Exceptions

#### HW:
- all exercises in Chapter 11
- read about exception handling
- sign up for GitHub and read about version control systems

## Agenda for Next classes
- mark down language files (0.5)
- Git/GitHub (1) (based on Linux)
    - go to github.com and create and account
- github for previous class: https://github.com/2020spring

- Selenium WebDriver : working with automated browser
